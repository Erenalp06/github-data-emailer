## Description

GitHub Repo Analyzer is a Spring Boot application that allows users to send a POST request to an endpoint with their GitHub username,
GitHub API key, and an email address. The application retrieves all repositories of the specified username using the GitHub API,
records statistics such as stars, forks, and interactions, and sends scheduled email reports to the user at specified intervals.

   cd your-repo
  ```
  
  2. **Configuration:** Open the `.yaml` extension file and make the necessary changes: <br>
  [Click here to view the application.properties file](/src/main/resources/application.yaml)

  ```yaml
  server:
    port: 8909
  
  Mail server
  spring:
    mail:
      host: <HOST_NAME> # smtp.gmail.com, smtp.yandex.com, smtp.live.com, smtp.mail.yahoo.com, smtp.mailgun.org, smtp.zoho.com
      port: <PORT> # 587, 465
      username: <YOUR_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME>
      password: <YOUR_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD>
      properties:
        mail:
          smtp:
            auth: true
            starttls:
              enable: true
              required: true
  
  Schedule task
  scheduled:
    task:
      initial-delay: 60000 # Initial delay: Specifies the time after which the task will be first executed, in milliseconds. For example, 300000 milliseconds corresponds to 5 minutes.
      fixed-delay: 300000 # Fixed delay: Specifies the time interval between the completion of one execution and the start of the next, in milliseconds. For example, 3600000 milliseconds corresponds to 1 hour.
      time-zone: Europe/Istanbul # Time zone: Specifies the time zone in which the cron expression will be resolved. For example, "America/New_York" or "GMT+10".
  ```
- Set your mail server's host, port, username, and password as per your mail server information.
- Adjust the initial-delay and fixed-delay values for the scheduled task according to your preferences.
- Modify the time-zone field to set the time zone in which the cron expressions will be resolved. For example, you can use "America/New_York" or "GMT+10".
